Steve felt called to leave Nashville and the music/entertainment business in 2005 with his wife, Kara, and four children.  They spent the next five years ministering in the Minneapolis area, during which time, Steve was being stripped of a career "identity crisis" and was in a long season learning what it "really" meant to worship the Lord and surrender all to Him.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/81638620-040e-4bce-bcca-0b94b2e789f4.jpg)

He didn't think he'd ever touch music again until the fall of 2009 when he wrote in his journal "You're going to score the Gospel", not knowing what that might mean.  In 2010 they moved to Windsor, Colorado to attend Ellerslie discipleship training and partnered with Pastor and author Eric Ludy, where Steve literally starting scoring gospel messages that have gone all over the world.  God brought music back into Steve's life, but on His terms, for His purposes.  He has recently launched a Christian music label with friends from Australia and Finland called [Irish Elk Music][0] based also in Windsor, CO.  Although in early development, it is a realization of a dream Steve's been carrying for well over fifteen years.

In 2014 the family adopted two sisters from Colombia and currently reside in the mountains near Estes Park, CO.
